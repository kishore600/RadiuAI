    1. get_population_within_radius()

        What it does: This is like playing "count the houses" from a helicopter! It looks at an area on a map and counts how many homes and apartments are there. For each home it finds, it imagines about 4 people live there (like a mom, dad, and two kids).

        How it works: It asks a special map computer (called Overpass API) to find all the buildings where people might live, then multiplies that number by 4 to guess how many people are in the area.

    2. get_income_index()

        What it does: This tries to guess if people in the area have lots of money or not much money. It does this by counting how many shops and businesses are nearby.

        How it works: It thinks: "If there are many fancy shops and businesses, people probably have more money to spend. If there aren't many shops, people might have less money."

    3. get_nearby_places()

        What it does: This looks around the neighborhood to see what other similar businesses already exist. It's like playing "I spy" for coffee shops, restaurants, or gyms.

        How it works: It searches the map for businesses that match what you want to open and makes a list of all the competitors nearby.

    4. calculate_confidence()

        What it does: This gives a "confidence score" that tells us how sure we are about our guesses. It's like when you're guessing how many jellybeans are in a jar - if you can see most of the jar, you're more confident than if you can only see the top.

        How it works: It looks at how much information we found - if we found lots of houses and many competitors, we're more confident. If we found very little information, we're less confident.

    5. get_business_type_multiplier() (The Main Function)

        What it does: This is the boss function that puts everything together! It's like making a recipe for deciding if a business will do well in a certain location.

        The recipe:

            1. Start with a basic guess - How well does this type of business usually do? (The "global baseline")

            2. Check how many customers might come - Count people in the area and guess how much money they have

            3. Check the competition - See how many similar businesses already exist

            4. Adjust the guess - If there are many people but few competitors → good location! If there are few people but many competitors → not so good

            5. Tell you how sure we are - Give a confidence score

        Example: If you want to open a lemonade stand:

            1. Basic guess: Lemonade stands usually do pretty well in summer (baseline = 1.2)

            2. Check the neighborhood: Are there many kids? Do they get allowance money?

            3. Check competition: Are there other lemonade stands nearby?

            4. Final decision: Good neighborhood with no other stands = great idea!
        

🔑 Why Current Accuracy is Low

    Population estimates → Based on residential building counts × 4 people = too rough. Real population density maps are needed.

    Income index → Derived from landuse counts. Doesn’t reflect true disposable income.

    Competition strength → Defaulting to “10 reviews × price level 1” is basically noise.

    No ground-truth calibration → You aren’t training against actual business revenue data.


✅ Steps to Push Accuracy >90%

    1. Get Better Input Data

        1. Population → Use real population density maps:

        2. WorldPop, Facebook Data for Good, or Indian census block data.

        3. Income → Use regional disposable income datasets (gov census, CMIE, World Bank sub-national data).

        4. Competition → Pull actual places + ratings + review counts from:

            Google Places API / Yelp / JustDial / TripAdvisor (scraping or API).

            These provide real popularity signals.

        5. Cultural Fit → Use search trend data (Google Trends: coffee vs chai by region).

        6. Seasonality → Pull actual sales proxies (e.g., Diwali retail spikes from market reports).

    2. Ground Truth Dataset (Gold Standard)

        You must train with real business revenue samples:

            1. Get historical data of 1,000–10,000 businesses:

                1. Public filings (big chains like Starbucks, Barista, etc.).

                2. Market reports (Euromonitor, Statista).

                3. Survey/scraped data from local businesses (many list daily avg sales on forums).

            2. Features: [lat, lon, business_type, population, income, competition, cultural_fit, investment]

            3. Label: actual_monthly_revenue.

    3. Switch to ML (Calibrated Model)

        1. Instead of returning baseline * local_adjustment, train a model:

        2. RandomForestRegressor / XGBoost → good for tabular + non-linear interactions.

        3. Train on features above, target = actual multiplier or revenue.

        4. This way the model learns how population, income, and competition interact in real-world settings.


📊 Example Evolution

        Today (MVP):
        Multiplier = baseline × (population proxy ÷ competition proxy) → ~50–60%.

        Step 1 (Data Upgrade):
        Add census population, income per ward, real Google Places competition. Accuracy jumps to ~70–80%.

        Step 2 (ML Calibration):
        Train ML model on 5k+ labeled businesses → Accuracy 85–90%.

        Step 3 (Continuous Learning):
        Live feedback loop from actual revenues (crowdsourced / survey) → Stabilizes >90%.

✅ So the roadmap for your function:

        Replace heuristic proxies with real datasets (population, income, competition).

        Collect a training dataset of actual revenues.

        Train & deploy a supervised ML model.

        Use heuristics only as fallback when no data is available.
