This Python tool helps businesses find and analyze competitors in a specific geographical area using OpenStreetMap data and provides integration with Google Maps.

1. json
    Purpose: Handling JSON data format
    Usage: Serializing/deserializing data from APIs and for output

2. requests
    Purpose: HTTP requests to APIs
    Usage:
        Querying Overpass API for business data
        Geocoding place names using Nominatim

3. time
    Purpose: Time-related functions
    Usage: Implementing rate limiting between API requests

4. sys
    Purpose: System-specific parameters
    Usage: Accessing Python executable for package installation

5. urllib.parse
    Purpose: URL parsing and manipulation
    Usage: Encoding URL parameters (though not explicitly used in current code)

6. typing
    Purpose: Type hints for better code documentation
    Usage: Defining function parameter and return types

7. dataclasses
    Purpose: Creating classes primarily for storing data
    Usage: Defining the Competitor data structure

8. haversine (external package)
    Purpose: Calculating geographical distances
    Usage: Computing distances between coordinates

1. Code Structure and Functionality
    
    @dataclass
    class Competitor:
        name: str
        type: str
        distance: float
        latitude: float
        longitude: float
        osm_id: str
        osm_type: str
        address: str = ""
        google_maps_url: str = ""

        Stores all relevant information about a competitor
        Includes Google Maps URL for easy navigation

2. CompetitorAnalyzer Class

    2.1 Key Methods:

    a. User Input Handling

        get_user_input(): Comprehensive input collection

        _get_location_input(): Flexible location input (coordinates or place name)

        _get_radius_input(): Search radius specification

        _get_business_types_input(): Business type selection with categories

    b. API Interaction

        search_competitors(): Queries Overpass API for business data

        _build_query(): Constructs specialized Overpass query based on business types

    c. Data Processing

        process_results(): Converts API response to Competitor objects

        _process_element(): Processes individual OSM elements

    d. Output Generation

        display_results(): Console output with formatting

        get_results_json(): JSON output for frontend consumption

        export_results(): Text file export capability

    2.2 How It Works - Step by Step

        Input Collection: Gets location (coordinates or place name), radius, and business types

        Geocoding: Converts place names to coordinates using Nominatim

        API Query: Builds and executes Overpass query to find businesses

        Data Processing: Converts raw API data to structured Competitor objects

        Distance Calculation: Uses haversine formula to compute distances

        Results Presentation: Displays formatted results with Google Maps links

        Export Option: Saves results to text file
