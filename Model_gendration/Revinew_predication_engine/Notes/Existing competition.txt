How to Increase Accuracy Above 90% and Data Collection Methods

1. Leverage Multiple Data Sources (Key to >90% Accuracy)

The biggest improvement comes from querying several APIs and merging the results. This compensates for the shortcomings of any single source.

    1. Google Places API: The gold standard for comprehensiveness and accuracy for businesses. It has the most extensive database.

        Endpoint: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json

        How: Use the type parameter (e.g., cafe, restaurant) and the radius parameter.

    2. OpenStreetMap (Overpass API): You are already using this. It's free and good, but incomplete.

    3. Foursquare / Places API: Another excellent source for rich venue data with categories.

    4. Yelp Fusion API: Great for user-reviewed businesses, especially in the US and Canada.

    Implementation Strategy:

    1. Create a function for each API (e.g., fetch_from_google_places(), fetch_from_foursquare()).

    2. Run these APIs concurrently using asyncio or concurrent.futures to avoid slowing down.

    3. Merge the results into a single list.

    4. Deduplicate entries by checking if the business names and coordinates are very close to each other (using fuzzy name matching and distance thresholding).

2 Ways to Collect Data

    1. OpenStreetMap (Free, current approach)

        Strength: Free, global.

        Weakness: Incomplete in some areas.

    2. Google Places API (Paid)

        Very high accuracy.

        Rich metadata (ratings, photos, opening hours).

        Expensive if you need lots of requests.

    3. Yelp / Foursquare API

        Great for food, retail, nightlife.

        Regional coverage varies.

    4. Government / Open Data

        Many cities release business registries (licensed businesses).

        Can be imported and cross-checked.

    5. Web Scraping

        Scrape local directories (Yellow Pages, JustDial, TripAdvisor).

        Needs legality check and maintenance.

    6. Crowdsourcing

        Let users contribute corrections ("This shop is closed", "New cafe opened").
