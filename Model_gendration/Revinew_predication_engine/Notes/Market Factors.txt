1. Main Function: get_market_factors(lat, lon, business_type, radius_km=5)

    Purpose: This is the main orchestrator function that calculates overall market factors affecting business revenue potential.

    How it works:

        Calls four sub-functions to get individual market factors:

        Rent Index (40% weight)

        Regulatory Environment (30% weight)

        Seasonality (20% weight)

        Competition Density (10% weight)

        Calculates weighted average of these factors

        Applies business-specific adjustments (some businesses are more sensitive to certain factors)

        Returns comprehensive results including confidence score and explanatory notes

        Example: For a clothing store in Delhi, it might return a market factor of 0.72, indicating moderately favorable conditions.

2. Rent Analysis: get_rent_index(lat, lon, radius_km, business_type)

    Purpose: Estimates how rental costs impact business viability (higher rent = lower score).

        How it works:

            Reverse geocoding to get country information from coordinates

            Tries OSM-based estimation first (counts commercial properties as proxy for rent prices)

            Falls back to country averages if OSM data is unavailable

            Normalizes to 0.1-1.0 scale where 1.0 = low rent (good), 0.1 = high rent (bad)

            Example: In expensive cities like New York, this might return 0.3-0.4. In affordable cities, it might return 0.8-0.9.

3. OSM Rent Estimation: estimate_rent_from_osm(lat, lon, radius_km, business_type)

    Purpose: Estimates rent prices by analyzing OpenStreetMap commercial property data.

    How it works:

        Queries OSM API for commercial properties in the specified radius

        Different queries for different business types (restaurants vs retail shops)

        Counts properties and estimates rent based on density

        Simple formula: Base rent × (1 + density factor)

        Limitation: This is a rough proxy - actual rent would vary significantly by specific location, property size, etc.

4. Country Rent Index: get_country_rent_index(country)
    Purpose: Provides fallback rent estimates based on country-level data.

    How it works:

        Pre-defined values for different countries

        Three tiers: High-cost (0.3-0.5), Medium-cost (0.6-0.7), Low-cost (0.8-1.0)

        Default value of 0.7 for countries not in the list

        Example: Switzerland = 0.3 (expensive), India = 1.0 (affordable)

5. Regulatory Analysis: get_regulatory_index(lat, lon)

    Purpose: Estimates how easy it is to do business based on regulatory environment.

    How it works:

        Reverse geocoding to get country code

        Uses simplified World Bank "Doing Business" data (pre-defined scores)

        Country codes mapped to scores: NZ/SG = 0.9 (easiest), BR/RU = 0.4 (most challenging)

        Note: Real implementation would need actual API integration with World Bank or similar data sources.

6. Seasonality Analysis: get_seasonality_index(lat, lon, business_type)
    Purpose: Estimates how seasonal variations affect the business.

    How it works:

        Gets current month to determine seasonal pattern

        Business-specific patterns:

        Ice cream: High in summer (0.9), low in winter (0.3)

        Ski resorts: High in winter (0.9), low in summer (0.1)

        Restaurants/retail: More consistent year-round (0.7-0.9)

        Limitation: This uses fixed patterns - real implementation would consider local climate, tourism patterns, etc.

7. Competition Analysis: get_competition_density(lat, lon, business_type, radius_km)
    
    Purpose: Measures how competitive the local market is.

    How it works:

        Queries OSM for same-type businesses in the area

        Counts competitors and converts to a factor

        Formula: 1.0 - (competitor_count × 0.09)

        0 competitors = 1.0 (excellent)

        5 competitors = 0.55 (moderate)

        10+ competitors = 0.1 (very challenging)

        Example: If there are 3 other clothing stores nearby, competition factor would be 0.73.

8. Business Adjustments: apply_business_specific_adjustments(market_factor, business_type)

    Purpose: Adjusts the overall market factor based on business type sensitivity.

    How it works:

        Restaurants/bars/cafes: More sensitive to market factors (×0.85-0.95)

        Pharmacies/supermarkets: Less sensitive (×1.05-1.10)

        Default: No adjustment (×1.0)

        Rationale: Some businesses are more resilient to market conditions than others.

9. Confidence Estimation: estimate_confidence(factors)

    Purpose: Estimates how reliable the market factor calculation is.

    How it works:

        Counts successful calculations (not using default fallback values)

        Calculates percentage of successful factors

        Returns 0.5-0.9 range (never 1.0 to indicate some uncertainty always exists)

        Example: If 3 out of 4 factors were successfully calculated, confidence = 0.75

10. Notes Generation: generate_market_notes(factors, market_factor)
    Purpose: Creates human-readable explanations of the market analysis.

    How it works:

        Checks each factor against thresholds

        Generates appropriate messages for high/low values

        Provides overall assessment based on final market factor

        Example: "High rental costs may impact profitability. Limited competition in the immediate area. Overall market conditions present significant challenges."
