1. get_current_location()

    Purpose: Finds your current location using IP geolocation
    How it works:

    Uses your IP address to estimate location

    Falls back to manual input if automatic detection fails
    Accuracy: ~60-70% (IP geolocation can be off by several km)

2. get_coordinates(place_name)

    Purpose: Converts place names to geographic coordinates

    How it works: Uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) geocoding service

    Accuracy: ~90-95% for well-known locations

3. create_circle_geojson(lat, lon, radius_km)

    Purpose: Creates a circular geographic area for API queries

    How it works: Calculates points around a circle using math

    Accuracy: 100% (pure mathematical calculation)

4. fetch_population_worldpop(lat, lon, radius_km)

    Purpose: Gets population data from WorldPop API

    How it works: Sends geographic area to WorldPop service

    Accuracy: ~70-80% when data is available

5. estimate_population_osm(lat, lon, radius_km)

    Purpose: Estimates population using building data from OpenStreetMap

    How it works: Counts residential buildings × 4 people/building × density factor

    Accuracy: ~50-70% (depends on OSM data completeness)

6. get_population_within_radius(lat, lon, radius_km)

    Purpose: Main population estimation with fallbacks

    How it works: Tries WorldPop → OSM → area-based estimation

    Accuracy: ~60-75% overall

7. get_income_index(lat, lon, radius_km)

    Purpose: Estimates area wealth using commercial activity

    How it works: Counts shops/restaurants/banks as prosperity indicators

    Accuracy: ~40-60% (indirect measurement)

8. get_nearby_places(lat, lon, radius_km, business_type)

    Purpose: Finds competing businesses in the area

    How it works: Queries OpenStreetMap for specific business types

    Accuracy: ~70-85% (depends on OSM data completeness)

9. calculate_confidence(population, competition_count)

    Purpose: Estimates how reliable the analysis is

    How it works: Based on data quantity and quality

    Accuracy: Self-assessment metric

10. analyze_business_location()

    Purpose: Main analysis function combining all factors

    How it works:

        Gets baseline industry multiplier

        Calculates local demand (population × income)

        Calculates local supply (competition)

        Adjusts baseline based on local conditions
        Accuracy: ~60-75% overall
