Overview

    This Python tool analyzes the cultural fit of a business type in a specific geographical location by:

        1. Reverse geocoding coordinates to determine the location

        2. Gathering local content from Wikipedia and other sources

        3. Analyzing the content for relevant keywords and sentiment

        4. Calculating a cultural fit score with seasonal and regional adjustments

Package Dependencies and Their Uses

Class Structure and Functionality

    FreeCulturalFitAnalyzer Class

        1. Keyword Database

            self.keywords = {
            "coffee": ["coffee", "espresso", "latte", ...],
            "tea": ["tea", "chai", "green tea", ...],
            # ... 12 categories total
            }

            Comprehensive keyword mapping for different business categories

        2. Seasonal Patterns

            self.seasonal_patterns = {
                "northern_hemisphere": {
                    "summer": [6, 7, 8],
                    "winter": [12, 1, 2],
                    # ...
                },
                # ...
            }

            Defines seasonal patterns for both hemispheres


Key Methods:

    a. Location Processing

        get_hemisphere(): Determines hemisphere based on latitude
        get_location_from_coords(): Reverse geocoding using Nominatim API

    b. Content Gathering

        get_wikipedia_content(): Fetches relevant Wikipedia content
        get_local_content(): Aggregates content from multiple sources
        generate_simulated_local_data(): Creates simulated data when APIs fail

    c. Analysis & Scoring

        analyze_text_for_keywords(): Analyzes content for relevant keywords
        calculate_cultural_fit(): Computes the cultural fit score
        apply_seasonal_adjustments(): Adjusts score based on current season
        apply_regional_adjustments(): Adjusts score based on regional preferences

    d. Main Function

        get_cultural_fit_score(): Primary method that orchestrates the entire analysis


How It Works - Step by Step

    1. Input Processing: Takes coordinates, business type, and analysis radius

    2. Reverse Geocoding: Converts coordinates to location details using Nominatim

    3. Content Collection: Gathers local information from Wikipedia and generates simulated data

    4. Keyword Analysis: Processes content to identify relevant business keywords

    5. Sentiment Analysis: Assesses positive/negative sentiment in the content

    6. Score Calculation: Computes cultural fit score with multiple adjustments

    7. Insight Generation: Creates human-readable insights from the analysis
