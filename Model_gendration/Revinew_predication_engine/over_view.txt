• Economic Modeling (Market factor calculations)


📊 The 6-Pillar Analytical Framework:

1. Traffic Score Engine 🚗
• What: Analyzes foot and vehicle traffic patterns
• How: Uses POI (Point of Interest) density and classification
• Output: 0-1 score predicting customer flow potential
• Key Metrics: Transport hubs, commercial areas, public spaces

2. Market Factor Analyzer 💰
• What: Evaluates economic viability

• Output: Weighted market suitability score (0-1)
• Considers: Operating costs, regulatory environment, market gaps

3. Population & Demand Engine 👥
• What: Estimates customer base and spending power
• How: Geographic population density + income analysis
• Output: Demand multiplier and competition ratio
• Key Insight: "How many people vs. how many competitors"

4. Income Profiler 💵
• What: Analyzes purchasing power
• How: Census data + geographic income distribution
• Output: Average income metrics and spending capacity
• Critical for: Pricing strategy and product mix decisions

5. Competitor Intelligence Module 🕵️
• What: Comprehensive competitor mapping
• How: Geospatial search + business classification
• Output: Detailed competitor database with distances, types, density
• Features: Distance analysis, market saturation metrics, gap identification

6. Cultural Fit Analyzer 🌍
• What: Assesses cultural compatibility
• How: Regional preference data + seasonal trends + sentiment analysis
• Output: Cultural alignment score (0-100%)
• Considers: Local preferences, seasonal factors, regional trends

• Demand-supply gaps (what needs aren't being met?)
• Cultural trends (what will locals actually buy?)
Economic sustainability (can the business survive financially?)
