1. Function Definition & Baseline Setup

    def analyze_business_location(business_type, lat, lon, radius_km=2):
        Purpose: Get the global industry standard multiplier for this business type. Different business types have different inherent profitability potentials (e.g., supermarkets = 1.5x, book stores = 0.7x).

2. Calculate Local Demand Score

    total_population = get_population_within_radius(lat, lon, radius_km)
    avg_income_index = get_income_index(lat, lon, radius_km)
    local_demand_score = total_population * avg_income_index

    Purpose: Calculate the total spending power in the area. More people Ã— higher income = greater potential customer base with money to spend.

3. Calculate Local Supply Score (Competition)

    competing_businesses = get_nearby_places(lat, lon, radius_km, business_type)
    competition_count = len(competing_businesses)

    total_competition_strength = 0
    for business in competing_businesses:
        strength = business.get('user_ratings_total', 10) * business.get('price_level', 1)
        total_competition_strength += strength

    local_supply_score = total_competition_strength

    Purpose: Measure both the quantity AND quality of competitors. A business with many ratings and higher prices is considered stronger competition than a small, unknown shop.

4. Calculate Local Adjustment (Key Algorithm)

    if local_supply_score == 0:
        local_adjustment = 1.8  # Bonus for no competition (capped)
    else:
        raw_ratio = local_demand_score / local_supply_score
        local_adjustment = 0.5 + 1.5 / (1 + math.exp(-0.000001 * (raw_ratio - 500000)))
        
    local_adjustment = max(0.5, min(2.0, local_adjustment))

    1. Purpose: This is the core algorithm that determines how much to adjust the baseline. It uses a sigmoid function to:

    2. Prevent extreme values: Caps between 0.5-2.0 (never too bad, never too good)

    3. Handle no competition: Gives a 1.8x bonus (but capped to avoid unrealistic values)

    4. Normalize ratios: A sigmoid curve prevents crazy multipliers from very high demand/supply ratios

5. Calculate Final Multiplier

    final_multiplier = baseline * local_adjustment

    Purpose: Combine the industry baseline with the local market conditions. A good business type in a good location gets multiplied advantages.

6. Calculate Confidence Score

    confidence = calculate_confidence(total_population, competition_count)

    Purpose: Indicate how reliable the analysis is. More population data and more competitor data = higher confidence in the results.

7. Generate Business Insights

    if competition_count == 0:
        notes = "No direct competitors found. High opportunity but verify local demand."
    elif competition_count < 3:
        notes = f"Low competition ({competition_count} competitors). Good market conditions."
    elif competition_count < 8:
        notes = f"Moderate competition ({competition_count} competitors). Viable market."
    else:
        notes = f"High competition ({competition_count} competitors). Consider differentiation."

    Purpose: Provide actionable advice based on competition levels. This helps users understand what the numbers mean.

8. Return Comprehensive Results

    return {
        "multiplier": round(final_multiplier, 2),
        "confidence": round(confidence, 2),
        "population": total_population,
        "competition_count": competition_count,
        "income_index": round(avg_income_index, 2),
        "notes": notes,
        "coordinates": (lat, lon),
        "radius_km": radius_km
    }

    Purpose: Return all the analysis components so users can see both the conclusion (multiplier) and the supporting data behind it.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Function is Useful:

    1. Quantifies Location Quality: Turns subjective "good location" into a measurable number

    2. Considers Multiple Factors: Population, income, competition strength (not just count)

    3. Industry-Aware: Different baselines for different business types

    4. Provides Context: Confidence score and notes explain the reliability and meaning

    5 . Prevents Over-optimism: Mathematical limits prevent unrealistic predictions
