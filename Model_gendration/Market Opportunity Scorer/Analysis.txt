 Market Opportunity Scorer

ðŸ“Š Component-by-Component Accuracy Breakdown:

	1. Population Data :-	  	 	35%	WorldPop API + OSM estimates, not real census data

	2. Income Estimation :-	      20%	Commercial activity proxy, not actual income data

	3. Competition Analysis :-    45%	OSM tags only, no real reviews/pricing data

	4. Demand Calculation :-	 50%	Reasonable formula but poor input data

	5. Scoring Algorithm :-	       70%	Good logic but limited by data quality

	6. Confidence Scoring :- 	  60%	Logical but based on estimated data


1. Demographics Data: 25% Accurate

	Uses OSM element count Ã— country factor instead of real population data
	
	Income levels are hardcoded by country (US=$4000, IN=$1500) - not local data
	
	Age composition is random (0.5-0.8) - not actual demographic data

2. Competition Analysis: 30% Accurate
	
	Counts OSM "amenity" and "shop" tags as competitors
	
	Doesn't differentiate between business types (restaurant vs IT company)
	
	No real market saturation data

3. Accessibility: 40% Accurate

	Counts highways from OSM (somewhat relevant)
	
	But no real traffic flow data or public transport schedules
	
	Parking availability is estimated from business density

4. Growth Potential: 20% Accurate
	
	Estimates from building density (not actual development projects)
	
	No real government plan data or economic indicators
	
	Generic country development factors

5. Cultural Factors: 15% Accurate

	Hardcoded country stereotypes (US: English 100%, France: 60%)
	
	No local cultural data or festival calendars
	
	No actual business customs research



ðŸŽ¯ Data Collection Strategy for 90%+ Accuracy:
